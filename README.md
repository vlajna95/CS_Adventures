# Adventures on the sea

A text game made with [ChoiceScript](https://github.com/dfabulich/choicescript), a language for making multichoice games from [Choice of Games](https://choiceofgames.com/).


## Main features

Once finished, the game will have these features (the list is growing):
- [x] Choose your name
- [x] Choose the color of your eyes
- [x] Choose the color and style of your hair
- Several worlds to explore
- Many characters to meet and interact with
- Different battles
- ...

Since this is my first CS game, it wont have the possibility to choose the gender of the main character. I'm writing it as male.


## Support needed

The game wont be sold, it will be available for free, but I have many little expenses. I will be grateful to everybody who wants to [donate on PayPal](https://paypal.me/DanijelaPopovic) or [become a patron](https://patreon.com/DanijelaPopovic).
